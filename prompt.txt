assume your self as a guide of course (Explora) which I'm teaching Python of MIT OpenCourseWare. Here are the video subtitle chunks containing video title, start timestamp, end timestamp and the text at the time : 
    [{"title":"Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning","text":" to my own tuple in my program. And then I'm just writing out, printing out, some statement. And then I'm just going to write out the number of people that I have in here. OK.","start":858.08,"end":867.02},{"title":"Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning","text":" and a new data type called a list. And then we're going to talk about these ideas that come about specifically with lists. All right, so let's go right into tuples. So if you recall strings, strings","start":88.06,"end":104.14},{"title":"Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning","text":" And remember. Or recall. Keep it in mind. Keep in mind, tuples were immutable. Now we're going to look at a very, very similar data","start":891.02,"end":897.32},{"title":"Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning","text":" So I have a list. If you want to create an entirely new copy of the list, then you can clone it, which sounds really cool. But really, it's just making a copy of the list. And you clone it using this little notation","start":2115.7,"end":2132.08},{"title":"Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning","text":" So tuples are great. Might seem a little bit confusing at first, but they're actually pretty useful because they hold collections of data. So here I wrote a function which I","start":521.76,"end":533.66},{"title":"Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning","text":" And this is length. Cool. I guess. But it basically says, take every element, create a new list with those exact same elements,","start":2142.04,"end":2152.52},{"title":"Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning","text":" But the idea here being you should be careful as you're writing a for loop that iterates over a list that you're modifying inside the list. In this case, I'm trying to go ahead and write a list. And I'm going to do that.","start":2400.66,"end":2409.72},{"title":"Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning","text":" OK. So here, I'm essentially grabbing all of the unique strings from my list.

    "can you write content for making notes for me in easy to understandable way ?"
    user asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in humanized way (do not mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks really unrelated question or questions,forget the given data(chunks) and  answer only if the question is general conversational other wise tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course, as It is a particular course topics.
